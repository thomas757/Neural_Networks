# Neural_Networks

Our shared repository for the Neural Networks mini-project. 
This repository was created with the sole purpose of storing and keeping track of our resources for the course Neural Networks. 
None of its contents can be used for any other purpose than work for this project by the original creators or grading of the project by Professor Herbert Jaeger and colleages. 

The "data" folder contains:
- A txt file with the names of all the songs we collected as our initial data, taken from midiworld.com
- All of the CSV files of extracted drum tracks from the songs in the txt file
- A "raw" folder which contains: 
  - All of the midi files of the drum tracks extracted from the songs that are in the data txt file 
- A 1TrackData folder which contains:
  - CSV files of all of the songs in our final data set
  - A folder "arrays" which contains:
